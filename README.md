In this activity i would use a scenario to show how security analyst can document a security incident.
**Scenario:** A small U.S. health care clinic specializing in delivering primary-care services experienced a security incident on a Tuesday morning, at approximately 9:00 a.m. Several employees reported that they were unable to use their computers to access files like medical records. Business operations shut down because employees were unable to access the files and software needed to do their job. Additionally, employees also reported that a ransom note was displayed on their computers. The ransom note stated that all the company’s files were encrypted by an organized group of unethical hackers who are known to target organizations in healthcare and transportation industries. In exchange for restoring access to the encrypted files, the ransom note demanded a large sum of money in exchange for the decryption key.
The attackers were able to gain access into the company’s network by using targeted phishing emails, which were sent to several employees of the company. The phishing emails contained a malicious attachment that installed malware on the employee’s computer once it was downloaded.
Once the attackers gained access, they deployed their ransomware, which encrypted critical files. The company was unable to access critical patient data, causing major disruptions in their business operations. The company was forced to shut down their computer systems and contact several organizations to report the incident and receive technical assistance.
**SOLUTION.**
First of all an incident to me in the cybersecurity world is defined as a occurence that jeopardized the CIA( confidentiality, integrity and availability of a system, network, device or an organization. Furthermore an incident journal is a documentation about an incident. The people or team who make use of this journal can be called the Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT). The incident journal include of;
The date of the incident.
The description of the incident
**The 5W’s of an incident which are;**
Who caused it?
What happened?
When did the incident occur?
Where did the incident occur?
Why did the incident happen?
Description: Operations were disrupted by a major security incident that occurred at a small primary-care clinic in the United States. Workers saw a ransom message on their computers and complained that they couldn’t access important information, such as medical records. According to the message, the company’s files were encrypted by an organized cybercriminal organization that targets the transport and healthcare industries, and they wanted a large ransome for the decryption key.

**The 5 W's;**
● Who caused the incident?
The incident was caused by an organized group of unethical hackers.
● What happened?
A ransomware was deployed by the unethical hackers with critical files of the clinic.
● When did the incident occur?
The incident happened on a a tuesday morning at approximately 9:00am
● Where did the incident happen?
The incident happened at a health care clinic in the US that specializes in delivering primary care services.
● Why did the incident happen?
The incident happened because unethical hackers were able to gain access to the company’s network by using a social engineering technique called Phishing emails, after gaining access to the clinic networks they then encrypted files whereby the clinic was unable to access critical files like patient data. The hackers' purpose was said to be a financial gain because a ransomware note appeared to the systems demanding a large sum of money.
**Recommendations**
● The Clinic should ensure that employees are well trained and aware by conducting phishing awareness programs.
● The Clinic should ensure they have an active and appropriate incident response plan tailored to ransomware attacks.
● The Clinic should strengthen their email security enhancement by making use of multifactor authentication (MFA) to add defense in depth for them and also email filtering solutions to block phishing attempts.
● The Clinic should implement Intrusion detection system (IDS) and Intrusion prevention system (IPS) to detect, prevent and eliminate any malicious activity.
